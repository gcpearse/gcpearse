# Hi, I'm Glen :wave:

## About me
> I'm currently studying with the October cohort of the **Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp**.
>
> This is a full-time, thirteen week bootcamp for aspiring full-stack developers.\
> The main language taught is **JavaScript**, but we have also covered **SQL**, **HTML** and **CSS**.
>
> We have just finished the backend block of the course, at the end of which I spent a week building a fully functional API.\
> This can be found in my public Northcoders News API repository.
>
> We are now moving onto the frontend, with an introduction to the DOM and React.js.

## Experience
> Before joining Northcoders, I spent a few months developing fundamental skills in the following areas:
> 
> - Python
> - JavaScript
> - HTML
> - CSS
> - Version control with Git and GitHub
